# Privacy Policy
## WE DO NOT STORE ANY DATA, MESSAGES, OR PERSONAL INFORMATION. PERIOD.
We physically can't. We have nowhere to store it. We don't even have a server database to store it. We don't even have a server. So even if our god Kusanali herself asked nicely to see your data, we wouldn't have anything to show her. 

**What happens in your server stays in your server. **
